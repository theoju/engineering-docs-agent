"""Deterministic repair of shortened citation paths (CCE-141).

`page-author` sometimes emits a citation as a bare relative path — the
committed page cited
`.claude/skills/connector-builder/references/checklist.md` at three sites and
the rewrite shortened it to `references/checklist.md`. `citation_exists`
correctly finds nothing at the repo root and blocks the page; post-CCE-140 the
deferral skip then abandons the PR, so the page is silently never written.

This module repairs the observable defect regardless of what causes it. The
safety argument is that a path is always a suffix of itself: if the page cited
`X` and now cites `suffix(X)`, that suffix necessarily matches `X`, so a UNIQUE
match is provably `X`. Repair cannot silently retarget a citation. Ambiguity
and zero-match both leave the page untouched and blocking, so repair can only
ever convert a block into a correct citation — never into a silent pass.
